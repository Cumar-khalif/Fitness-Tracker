# Unit 18 Nosql : Workout Tracker

I created a Fitness tracker that allows users to keep up with their daily workout.

## User Story
* A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.

* As a user, I am able to view create and track daily workouts. I can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. 
I can also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

  * Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

  * View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
